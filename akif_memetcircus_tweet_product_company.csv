Neg,I sure as hell better be able to restore my calendar events. Terrible bug apple! @apple #icloud #anothericloudfail
Neg,I really hate that @apple won't let you hide the Newsstand app or move it into a folder. It serves no purpose for me.
Neg,Life was much easier when @apple and @BlackBerry were just fruits!
Neg,@apple No location reminders on ipad2! That was the point of updating to iOS 5
Neg,Comparing @Office #live with @google #apps and @apple #iCloud  I do not see #iCloud leading the crowd. Do you agree ?
Neg,RT @MikeFerri: If @apple doesn't fix iOS5 this week I'm buying a droid #emptythreats
Neg,Turns out my computer isn't as fixed as it is meant to be. Fuck you @Apple I'm going back to your Genius Bar to complain. #annoyed

Neg,Had issues with #Siri reaching network today. Too many uses or my signal? @apple
Neg,The new iOS5 completely failed at upgrading the phone. Now I'm stuck in this restore loop. Thanks @apple for wasting my day. Can i undo?
Neg,Is it me or does #iPhone4s run a little warm sometimes? @apple
Neg,@apple WTF why can we not add the newsstand to a folder?! We are already in your walled garden so please don't remind us of it.
Neg,@apple just now seeing none of my Microsoft Office programs work anymore after Lion upgrade. Why??

Neg,@apple I'm still waiting for you to deliver my phone to @sprint
Neg,I will never purchase another @Apple product for the rest of my life. I am glad Steve Jobs is fucking dead. MAY YOU FUCKING ROT IN HELL!!!!!
Neg,Thanks to @Apple my new iMac is a brick. I cannot re-install Lion and I cannot purchase it because it was installed by the former owner.
Neg,Asked #Siri Where's Baby Lisa? and was told sorry I'm having trouble connecting to the network right now. @apple server fail. #ios5
Neg,Only thing #iOS.5 has done is deleted my tiger woods game and made impossible to retrieve. Thanks @Apple!

Neg,yo @apple this update is a disaster
Neg,Dear @AppleCongratulations I am suing my insurance company and you just managed to make it to the top of my shit list. #Ineedthosepictures
